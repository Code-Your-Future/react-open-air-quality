## CodeYourFuture: Air quality checker

This is an example to help you with the test at https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/react-unhcr.

This app uses the *Open Air Quality* API to get a list of countries, then populate
a dropdown box. Selecting a country will display the last air quality measurement
for it. API documentation: https://docs.openaq.org/.

Please feel free to use the structure of this application as an example for your test,
but try to avoid direct copies.

*Note:* While in the original test there is a component called "CountryDetails",
in this application there is one called "MeasurementDetails". They serve the same
purpose.
